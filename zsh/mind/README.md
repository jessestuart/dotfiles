### `mind`
I'm working on refining my workflow for saving references to projects,
source code, etc that I want to come back and revisit later so as not to
break my flow in the moment.
The two main requirements for this are:

1. Is has to be fast, and get out of my way; or I won't use it.
1. It has to provide useful abstractions for creating structure around this
   web of links and resources.

Namely: if a record is saved and never revisited because I've forgotten about
it (or it's gotten buried amongst myriad other resources), **then that was
time (and potentially opportunity) wasted**.
